-How to set the correct Convar-
1. Set special limit
-l4d_infectedbots_charger_limit
-l4d_infectedbots_boomer_limit 
-l4d_infectedbots_hunter_limit
-l4d_infectedbots_jockey_limit
-l4d_infectedbots_smoker_limit
-l4d_infectedbots_spitter_limit
These 6 values combined together must greater than or equal to 
-l4d_infectedbots_max_specials
Note that this max limit does not count tank and witch in coop/survival, but it does count tank in versus

2. adjust special limit if 5+ players
For example.
-l4d_infectedbots_max_specials "4"
-l4d_infectedbots_add_specials "2"
-l4d_infectedbots_add_specials_scale "3"
This means that if server has 5+ survivors, each 3 players join, max specials limit plus 2
So if there are 10 survivors, specials limit: 4+2+2 = 8

3. adjust tank health if 5+ players
For example
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_tankhealth_enable "1"
-l4d_infectedbots_default_tankhealth "4000"
-l4d_infectedbots_add_tankhealth "1200"
-l4d_infectedbots_add_tankhealth_scale "3"
This means that if server has 5+ survivors, each 3 players join, tank health increase 1200hp
So if there are 10 survivors, tank health: 4000+1200+1200 = 6400hp

To close this feature, do not want to overrides tank HP by this plugin, set
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_tankhealth_enable "0"

4.adjust special infected spawn timer
Reduce certain value to spawn timer based per alive player,For example
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_time_max "60"
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_time_min "30"
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_spawn_times "1"
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_reduced_spawn_times_on_player "2"
If there are 5 "ALIVE" survivors in game, special infected spawn timer[max: 60-(5*2) = 50, min: 30-(5*2) = 20], to close this feature, just set 
-l4d_infectedbots_adjust_spawn_times "0"

5.how to spawn tank
For example.
-l4d_infectedbots_tank_limit "2"
-l4d_infectedbots_tank_spawn_probability "5"
This means that each time 5% chance to spawn tank instead of infected bot. 
Note that if tank limit is reached or is 0, still don't spawn tank(does not affect director tanks)

6. Play infected team in coop/survival
For example.
-l4d_infectedbots_coop_versus "1"
-l4d_infectedbots_admin_coop_versus "1"
-l4d_infectedbots_coop_versus_human_limit "2"
Only adm can join the infected team, and there are only 2 infected team slots for real player

If you want everyone can join infected, then set
-l4d_infectedbots_admin_coop_versus "0"

make tank always be playable by real infected player
-l4d_infectedbots_coop_versus_tank_playable "1" 

7. Spawn range
Must be careful to adjust, these convars will also affect common zombie spawn range.
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_range_max "1500"
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_range_min "550"
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_range_final "300" 

Make infected player spawn near very close by survivors for better gaming experience
-l4d_infectedbots_spawn_range_min "0"
